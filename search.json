The availability of unbiased\n    timely statistics of trends in disease events are a key to effective\n    responses. But due to reporting delays, the most recently reported\n    numbers are frequently underestimating the total number of\n    infections, hospitalizations and deaths creating an illusion of a\n    downward trend. Here we describe a statistical methodology for\n    predicting true daily quantities and their uncertainty, estimated\n    using historical reporting delays. The methodology takes into\n    account the observed distribution pattern of the lag. It is derived\n    from the “removal method”, a well-established estimation framework\n    in the field of ecology. We show how the method works for both the\n    Swedish and the UK death count.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJonas Wallin, Adam Altmejd, and Joacim Rocklöv. 2021. “Nowcasting\nCovid-19 Statistics Reported with Delay.
